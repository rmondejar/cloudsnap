# CloudSNAP: a transparent PaaS for decentralized web deployment

This platform uses distributed P2P interception (distributed AOP) techniques to build its transparent infrastructure. This transparency makes easier the transition from standard web systems to cloud platforms.

The current prototype implements dynamic load-balancing, session tracking, and persistence services using the Damon middleware. In addition, this prototype is validated and tested in real large-scale scenarios. 

CloudSNAP is a free and open source software released under the terms of the LGPL License and written in Java.
